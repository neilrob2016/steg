Steg
----
This is a basic steganography program that hides data inside what looks at
face value like uuencoded or base64 encoded data. These can be run through the
respective decoders without errors (hopefully) but the output will be junk. The 
steganography uses 1,2 or 4 bits in every output byte to hide the encoded data 
which can optionally be xor'd with a key using the -k option and/or random data
generated by the built in LSFR seeded with the -s option. 

This probably wouldn't fool MI5/6/CIA etc for more than 5 mins unless you
use a very long key. Though even then I wouldn't lay money on it. However it
will hopefully prevent amateur hour hackers snooping on your data.

This software has been compiled and tested on Linux and MacOS. Type "make"
to compile.
